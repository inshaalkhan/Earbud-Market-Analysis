# Earbud-market-data-analysis-Dashboard
This comprehensive project involved web scraping to collect raw data, followed by meticulous cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality. Leveraging my analytical skills, I performed in-depth analysis on the cleaned datasets, extracting valuable insights related to product trends, user behavior, and market dynamics.

The analytical findings were then translated into visually compelling representations through effective data visualization techniques. Utilizing tools such as Tableau, I developed dynamic dashboards and reports that presented key patterns and trends in a user-friendly format. This project not only honed my data scraping and cleaning capabilities but also strengthened my proficiency in deriving actionable insights and communicating them through impactful visualizations. Overall, this experience showcases my ability to handle the entire data analysis pipeline and extract meaningful information from complex datasets
